# Talk about AIM to developers in AWS ("From earth to the cloud." program)

For a while now, I’ve wanted to contribute as an AWS Community Builder through my cloud knowledge. This time, with the Women Who Code Medellín team, we organized a 4-hour course where I primarily taught developers about IAM and its various use cases in AWS.

I’m very happy to contribute to Women Who Code's mission. It’s essential that we continue to grow equitably across all fronts as a society, including technology.

### A gift from the team
