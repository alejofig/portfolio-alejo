# Studying for a master’s degree—in 2024?

In 2021, as I was finishing my first professional stage at Simetrik, I attempted to create a mobile app for financial expense management. The idea was to store daily transactions and automate them. For three months, I worked with a group of designers and developers. Although we accomplished some interesting things, I realized there was an opportunity for improvement in terms of leading teams, developing software, and creating value. That’s when I decided to seek a way to fill that need, which led me to MISO—a Master’s in Software Engineering (taught at the top university in the country) with industry-experienced professors, a curriculum focused on team-based practice, and a fully virtual format.

I was accepted, and so began a challenging yet rewarding two-year journey. I learned about agile methodologies, software architecture, cloud computing, interface design, testing, and mobile development. But above all, I learned from my classmates how to work as a team, recognize each other’s skills, and build a sense of community.

So, yes, studying for a master’s degree in 2024. Not for the diploma, not just to learn the theory, but to apply it, to gain the tools to lead, build, and make an impact.

Thank you to Juan, Albert, Beatriz, and Sebas. And to the professors: Dario, Gloria, and Mario, for their time and teachings.
