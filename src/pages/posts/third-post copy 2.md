# First experience as speaker in a AWS Summit

On July 18th, I had the opportunity to give a talk on a Bedrock use case with AWS for financial control. If you'd like more details, you can check it out <a href="https://medium.com/@1alejofig1/daily-expenses-serverless-with-aws-and-openai-c3340119255c">here</a> . Personally, this was very exciting for me because two years ago, I had the chance to attend as a participant, and this time, presenting was an immense thrill. I thank AWS for the invitation and look forward to continuing to learn and contribute to the community.
