# League of Legends finals at Korea

Gaming has been a constant in my life, from that Christmas gift from my dad that marked the beginning of my gaming journey with a Nintendo 64 to hours spent strategizing in Age of Empires and Warcraft on my computer. But one game, in particular, has been my companion for over 12 years: League of Legends.

I've watched this game evolve and witnessed the magic of the Worlds, where the world's best players compete for glory. From Faker's feats in 2014 to being present at a Latin American team stop in 2015, League of Legends has been a part of my life and my passion.

In parallel, I've built my career in the world of technology and the cloud, focusing on Amazon Web Services (AWS). My journey took me from deploying my first data pipelines (at Simetrik) to obtaining two certifications and joining the AWS Community Builders program earlier this year.

And now, a unique opportunity has presented itself: an invitation from AWS to attend the League of Legends World Championship finals in Korea! The possibility of seeing Faker in action is simply incredible.

I decided to accept this challenge because one of the most important things to me is stepping out of my comfort zone and facing new experiences that push me to grow and develop skills I couldn't acquire in my day-to-day life.
